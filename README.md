## **Background**
Deposit is a banking investment product that allows customers to store their money for a specific period and withdraw it along with the interest (return) at an agreed time. Banks need the money stored in the form of deposits to maintain the company's liquidity and to increase profit, as the money deposited can be lent to other customers, allowing the bank to earn interest from loans. Therefore, banks are usually very active in seeking deposit investment customers, considering its nature as a win-win solution where both parties benefit.

The current limitation when bank marketing agents promote their deposit products is the lack of customer filtering beforehand, which often leads to contacting customers who are not potential (refusing to invest), making marketing activities less efficient and not yielding optimal results. Therefore, a special instrument is needed to filter customers. One of the instruments that can be used is a machine learning classification model that can predict how potential a customer is to accept a deposit investment offer. The advantage of using a machine learning model is that it can be continuously trained with new data, making this instrument more robust against the dynamics of customer characteristics.

## **Objective**
The objective of this project is to enhance the efficiency of the marketing team's activities by developing a model that can predict clients who are likely to invest in term deposits. A potential client is defined as one who, based on their characteristics (reflected by the values of various features), is highly likely to accept a term deposit investment offer after the telemarketing process. By using the developed model, the bank is expected to improve the efficiency of telemarketing activities by first filtering the client data so that the clients contacted by telemarketers/marketing agents are those who have a high potential (potential clients) to accept the term deposit investment offer.

## **About the dataset**

This dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was collected between May 2008 and November 2010 (2 years and 6 months) during telemarketing campaigns conducted by a bank in Portugal. The goal of these campaigns was to attract clients/customers to invest in term deposit instruments.

## **Conclusion**

1. The model is evaluated using the recall metric because the goal is to predict individuals who are likely to default, thereby minimizing false negatives. A false negative occurs when a customer is predicted to be able to pay the credit bill in the next month but fails to do so in reality
   
2. Three models were trialed in default mode: logistic regression, KNN, and SVM. Among these, the logistic regression model achieved the highest recall value on both the training and test datasets, with a recall of 1 (or 100%) for each prediction.
   
3. Despite the logistic regression's high recall, the SVM model was chosen for the following reasons:

  - The recall value produced by the SVM model in default mode is very close to that of the logistic regression (0.97 on the training dataset and 0.96 on the test dataset)
  - Overfitting is not significant, as the difference between the recall values of the training and test datasets is only 0.01. Specifically, the training dataset achieved a recall of 0.97, while the test dataset 
    achieved a recall of 0.96
   
4. The recall value generated by the Polynomial SVM model with tuned hyperparameters is 1 (or 100%), whereas the default SVM model (RBF kernel) produced a recall of 0.96 (or 96%). This indicates that the Polynomial SVM model with hyperparameter tuning improved the recall by 4% compared to the default SVM model. In other words, the Polynomial SVM model with hyperparameter tuning has a 4% lower error rate in predicting customer categories that are likely to default

## **Business Recommendation**

1. Consider creating preventive measures such as **early intervention programs**, personalized payment plans, or targeted intensive communication for those predicted to default.
2. Provide customers with information at the beginning of the agreement about the consequences of defaulting and what they should do if they realize they are going to default

## **Model Improvement Recommendation**

1. Regularly update the model with new data to ensure its effectiveness over time. Periodic retraining and hyperparameter tuning can help maintain or improve the model's performance, ensuring that it adapts to any changes in customer behavior or economic conditions
